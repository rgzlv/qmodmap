qmodmap makes keybindings for Quartz - the MacOS graphics layer which also
deals with events, including for keybindings.

The keybindings are read from a file, either one given as an argument or the
default $HOME/.qmodmaprc file.
Inside the file the key names can be given in the xmodmap syntax which comes
from X11/keysymdef.h but without the "XK_" prefix.
Unlike xmodmap though, there's no "keysym" or "keycode", everything is assumed
to be a keysym, and you can have more than one keysym on the left of the "=",
in that case it maps a key combination.
Same goes for the right side, multiple keysyms can be given.
Keysyms names are case-insensitive.
Assigning the left side of a mapping to "voidsymbol" makes it ignored.
Blank lines, blanks (space and tab) and comments follow by any number of blanks
are ignored.
Comments are introduced by a "!".
For an example, see the rc/86box file.

Also, unlike xmodmap, qmodmap runs as a foreground daemon and will need the
accessibility permission in settings for whatever program is used to run it,
for example the Terminal.app, otherwise it'll fail to create the event tap
needed to capture key events with the message
"CGEventTapCreate: Operation not permitted"
and prompt for the permission.
